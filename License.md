                            Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
 for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to
 ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network
 server software.

 [THE REMAINDER OF THE LICENSE TEXT MUST FOLLOW HERE EXACTLY, INCLUDING
 ALL SECTIONS 0–18 (TERMS AND CONDITIONS), WARRANTIES, AND ALL OTHER
 PROVISIONS FROM THE OFFICIAL AGPL‑3.0 TEXT.]

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

    “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
    “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
    “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
    ...

 [ALL SECTIONS 1, 2, 3, … THROUGH SECTION 18, CORRESPONDING SOURCE,
  CONVEYING MODIFIED SOURCE VERSIONS, PATENTS, NO WARRANTY, ETC.]

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
    HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT
    WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
    DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
    OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
    AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
    OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
    above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
    approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
    connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
    liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
 effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
 have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full
 notice is found.

       <one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of
        what it does.>
       Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

       This program is free software: you can redistribute it
       and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General
       Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
       either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any
       later version.

       This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
       useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
       warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE.  See the GNU Affero General Public License for more
       details.

       You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
